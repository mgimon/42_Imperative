# About push_swap

Push_swap is a simple algorithmic project where you need to sort data. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, two stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both. Your goal is to use the minimum number of instructions possible.

This project is an introduction to efficiency and it teaches different approaches to sorting algorithms.

## ðŸŸ  Operations


| Operations | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| sa | swap a - swap the first two elements at the top of stack a. |
| sb | swap b - swap the first two elements at the top of stack b. |
| ss | swap a and swap b at the same time. |
| pa | push a - take the first element at the top of stack b and put it at the top of stack a. |
| pb | push b - take the first element at the top of stack a and put it at the top of stack b. |
| ra | rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by one position. The first element becomes the last one. |
| rb | rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by one position. The first element becomes the last one. |
| rr | ra and rb at the same time. |
| rra | reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by one position. The last element becomes the first one. |
| rrb | reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by one position. The last element becomes the first one. |
| rrr | rra and rrb at the same time. |

## ðŸŸ  Compilation and Testing


Execute: 

```
make
```

Then execute:
```
./push_swap value1 value2 ... value500
```

Or download multiple-input tester by gemartin99 (
`https://github.com/gemartin99/Push-Swap-Tester` )

And execute:
```
bash push_swap_test.sh
```

Note for this project: âœ… 5/5 (A* search algorithm)
