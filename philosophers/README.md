# About philosophers
This project is an exercise designed to practice the creation and coordination of multiple threads to solve the classical problem of the philosophers. The threads should operate in an orderly manner, and accessing resources shared between threads might result in data races, which must be prevented from happening.

Each philosopher should perform a routine consisting of various actions such as eating, thinking, or sleeping, but they can only eat by successfully grabbing two objects called forks. Thus, the threads should be coordinated in scenarios where different philosophers try to grab different forks, so that no philosopher dies of hunger.

The program might behave differently depending on the OS.

<br>

Executing the program:
```
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> (optional)<minimum_number_of_meals_before_stop>
```
<br>

| Execution | Expected result |
| :--- | :--- |
| ./philo 1 800 200 200 | One philosopher should die |
| ./philo 5 800 200 200 | No philosopher should die |
| ./philo 5 800 200 200 7 | No philosopher should die, but simulation stops |
| ./philo 4 410 200 200 | No philosopher should die |
| ./philo 4 310 200 100 | One philosopher should die |
