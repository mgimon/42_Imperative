# About pipex

Pipex is an exercise designed to facilitate the maintenance of multiple processes and their communication with one another in Unix-like systems. This requires the creation of pipes and the management of process outputs and inputs to these pipes, ensuring effective inter-process communication, particularly in error handling scenarios.

Executing the following:
```
./pipex infile.txt "command1" "command2" outfile.txt
```

The program should do as the shell instruction:
```
< infile.txt command1 | command2 > outfile.txt
```

## ðŸŸ  Compilation:
Execute
```
make
```
