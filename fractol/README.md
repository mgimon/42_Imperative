## About fract'ol

"Fract'ol" is a simple computer graphics project that uses the miniLibX graphics library. It involves the mathematical idea of complex numbers and offers a chance to delve into optimization concepts in CGI while practicing event handling.

## Requirements

The program offers Julia and Mandelbrot sets. Using miniLibX, the program should:
- Calculate points belonging to the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
- Create an image with these points referenced by a pointer within a structure.
- Display this image in a window and keep it open. The user can close it at any time without memory leaks.
- Upon mouse or keyboard events, refresh the image in the window so the user can navigate through the fractal and zoom infinitely (within the limits of the computer).

## Compilation

Execute:

`make`

`./fractol mandelbrot`

or

`./fractol julia <value1> <value2>`
